# Pick your own project

This is a pokemon game where:
-you can search for pokemon and view their stats
-select up to 6 for your team (these can be removed and changed as needed)
-you can view you Team
-then you can play a top trumps type game against the computer (only you make selections though)

Tech stuff
-Uses pokeapi
-There are no tests due to a tough week
-scss was used in a last min rush
-little attention was given to BEM, pure functions
